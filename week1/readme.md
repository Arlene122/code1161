TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.
I learned how to set up anaconda and how to launch vs coding within the application.
I learned what debugging does (reads the data line by line)
I now know the basics to navigate through Visual studio Code
There were a few difficulties downloading and setting up all the softwares
