TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.
Completeing these exercises I know how to make a string using " " 
I have learned how to create loops and can understand how they work.
I understand how to put something in a list and how to set the range in a loop
I understand what a function is how how to properly use a colen :
I also improved on frinding key words to search and find information on how to perform a certain task
However i had trouble with the coordinate loop on excersise 3 and i couldnt seem to understand using a string and an interger together
