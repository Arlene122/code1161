TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear
I was able to return new dictionaries with information pulled from a file. (learning how to read a json file).
While i could not complete the word pyramid i think i was somewhat close. I applied the knowledge of for loops from week 2.
I also learnt how to create a file using python.
i was confused with the underground task.
