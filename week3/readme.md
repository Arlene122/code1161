TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.
I learnt the basics about while loops - how it only ends once it becomes false.
I learned how to set a range or the condition for while loop, this will determin when it becomes false
i now have a better understanding of if/else and how to combine multiple commands. 

This exersie took forever. 
The coding works in terminal, however it didnt work through the test file :( dont know why!
