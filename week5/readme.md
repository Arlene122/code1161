TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.
I have learnt how to calculate triangles using basic maths and applying it to python
I created a countdown using a while loop. 
I was anle to apply knowledge from other weeks excerises to this weeks exersies
however could not seem to figure out how to calculate the aspect of a triangle
